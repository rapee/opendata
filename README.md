# Thailand Data

Commonly used data in the context of Thailand that I've always wished some one did this so I don't have to. End up doing it myself.

## List of data

- [Common Thai person name](https://github.com/rapee/opendata/blob/master/thai_person_name.csv)
- [Thailand provinces, amphoes and tambons](https://github.com/rapee/opendata/tree/master/map)

I tried to reference to original data source and how to prepare data as good as I can.

The more people use, the better.
