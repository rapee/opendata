# Thailand Data

Commonly used data in the context of Thailand that I've always wished some one did this so I don't have to. End up doing it myself.

## List of data

- [Common Thai person name](https://github.com/rapee/opendata/tree/master/person_name)
- [Thailand provinces, amphoes and tambons](https://github.com/rapee/opendata/tree/master/map)

## Disclaimer

References to original source and how to prepare data are documented in each data set. Feel free to suggest errata or references to better data source.
